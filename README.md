## 👋 Hi, I'm Tarik  

I am a **Software Engineer** with **5 years of professional experience** and a **Bachelor's in Computer Science**.

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white) ![Spring](https://img.shields.io/badge/spring-%236DB33F.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white) ![Spring Boot](https://img.shields.io/badge/spring_boot-%236DB33F.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=springboot&logoColor=white) ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)

I work primarily within the **Java/Spring** ecosystems, while also being comfortable with **React**.  

Next to my daily activities at **[ZIRA](https://ziragroup.com)**, I dedicate my free time to expanding my engineering toolkit.

### 🔭 What I'm currently working on
*   **Reactive Chat App:** I'm building a [chat application](https://github.com/tmehulic-chat-app) to experiment with **WebSockets** and the reactive paradigm using **Spring WebFlux**.

### 🌱 What I'm currently learning
*   **Design Patterns:** I'm doing a deep dive into software design patterns, specifically focusing on their application within the **Spring Framework** to enhance my architectural skills.
